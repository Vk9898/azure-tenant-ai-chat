## 👨🏻‍💻 Run Locally

Clone this repository locally or fork it to your Github account.

### Prerequisites

- Neon Account: Create a Neon account on [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/) or via the [Azure](https://fyi.neon.tech/azureportal). If you have created your Azure resources using the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) in this repo, it will create automatically Neon instance on Azure.

- Identity Provider (Optional): For local development, you do not need it. If you prefer to use an Identity Provider, [follow the instructions](/docs/add-identity.md) to configure one.

### Steps

1. Change directory to the `src` folder
2. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env.local` and populate the environment variables (At least [Azure OpenAI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Capi-key%2Cjavascript-keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-typescript#retrieve-resource-information) to test out AI Chat feature).
3. Retrive the Neon API Key: Create [create a new API Key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) and set it in the `.env.local ` file to the value of `NEON_API_KEY`.
4. Install npm packages by running `npm install`
5. Start the app by running `npm run dev`
6. It automatically creates a new database for each new user on Neon database and populates schemas from `./data/schema.sql` SQL file used in the application.
7. Access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> [!NOTE]
> If using Basic Auth (DEV ONLY) any username you enter will create a new user id (hash of username@localhost). You can use this to simulate multiple users. Once successfully logged in, you can start creating new conversations.


## Deployment Options

### Prerequisites

- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.

## Azure Deployment Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator - Sample Estimate](https://azure.com/e/6575aeb258c54e9a84e06e90d4a0ab0c) for the resources below.

- Neon Serverless Postgres: Free US$0.00/month, free plan includes 10 projects, 0.5 GB storage, 190 compute hours, autoscaling up to 2 CU, read replicas, 90+ Postgres extensions including pgvector extension.
- Azure App Service: Premium V3 Tier 1 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB Storage. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure Open AI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Embedding models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Form Recognizer: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Form Recognizer by changing the parameters file under the `./infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, you can have the free Form Recognizer resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Form Recognizer by reducing the number of documents you upload.

> [!WARNING]
> To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to destroy your provisioned resources by deleting the resource group.


## About Neon

 [Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a serverless, fully managed PostgreSQL database service optimized for modern applications. Neon's advanced features include autoscaling, scale-to-zero, database branching, instant point-in-time restore, and time travel queries. Neon manages the Postgres infrastructure, including database configuration, maintenance, and scaling operations, allowing you to focus on building and optimizing your applications.

# Database Management

## Schema Management

The database schema is defined in a centralized location at `lib/db/schema.ts`. This ensures consistency across the application and helps avoid schema drift between different parts of the codebase.

### Schema Structure

All tables and indexes are defined in the `SchemaDefinition` object, which includes:

- Core application tables (chat_threads, documents, etc.)
- Standard indexes for performance optimization
- Vector indexes for similarity search operations

### Initialization Tools

The application provides several tools for managing the database schema:

1. **Automatic Initialization**: The schema is automatically initialized when a new user account is created, in the auth flow.

2. **Manual Initialization**: You can manually initialize or reset a database using the utility script:

   ```bash
   # Initialize the default database (specified by DATABASE_URL)
   npx ts-node lib/db/init-db.ts
   
   # Initialize a specific database
   npx ts-node lib/db/init-db.ts "postgres://your-connection-string"
   ```

3. **Diagnostic Tools**: Tools to check the database status are available in the `tools/` directory:

   ```bash
   # Check the default database
   npx ts-node tools/db-validator.ts
   
   # Check a specific user's database
   npx ts-node tools/user-db-check.ts
   ```

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

The application uses a multi-tenant database architecture where:

1. Each user gets their own Neon database project
2. The user's database connection string is stored in their session
3. All operations use the appropriate database based on the current user

This architecture provides strong isolation between users while still allowing for centralized administration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter database issues:

1. Check the `neon.md` file for known issues and solutions
2. Run the diagnostic tools to check the database status
3. Examine the schema corrections table to see any errors during schema initialization
4. If necessary, re-initialize the schema using the manual initialization tool
