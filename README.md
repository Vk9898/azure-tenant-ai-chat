# Azure Tenant AI Chat Solution Accelerator

## Introduction

Tenant AI Chat Solution Accelerator uses [Neon Serverless Postgres](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/neon/overview) on Azure to allow organisations to deploy a private chat tenant in their Azure Subscription with dedicated database per user on Neon. It is a modified version of [Azure Chat Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat) by replacing [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/azure/search/) and [Azure CosmosDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/) with [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for chat data storage and search functionality.

## Features

- 📀 **Database per user**: Keeps chat data isolated by creating a separate database instance per user.
- 🔑 **Authentication and User Management**: Allows flexible login options, including OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Conversations**: Chat with documents such as PDF. You can also buiild your own prompt templates.
- 💾 **Chat History**: Stores chat history with multiple chat threads, messages, and metadata.
- 🎨 **Customizable Chat Personas**: Personalizes conversations with user-defined chat personas. Manage persona settings directly from the application interface.
- 🛠️ **Extensions Support**: Extends chat functionalities by defining custom extensions. Store and manage extensions in the database, allowing dynamic interaction with custom workflows.
- 🎙️ **Speech and Voice Support**: Enables multilingual voice interactions in the chat application. Integrate Azure Speech Service for speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
- 🌐 **Deployment-Ready Architecture**: Fully deployable to Azure App Service with scalability for enterprise workloads.

## Demo

## Solution Benefits

- **Private**: Offers both application and database level isolation with standalone single-tenant app with single-tenant database. You can use it with your own internal data sources (PDFs, Docs) or integrate with your internal services (APIs)
- **Cost-Efficient**: Combines relational storage, vector storage in a single platform reduces the need for additional services, lowering costs. Scale efficiently as your user base grows while keeping costs manageable.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Run Locally

Clone this repository locally or fork it to your Github account.

### Prerequisites

- Neon Account: Create a Neon account on [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/) or via the [Azure](https://fyi.neon.tech/azureportal). If you have created your Azure resources using the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) in this repo, it will create automatically Neon instance on Azure.

- Identity Provider (Optional): For local development, you do not need it. If you prefer to use an Identity Provider, [follow the instructions](/docs/add-identity.md) to configure one.

### Steps

1. Change directory to the `src` folder
2. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env.local` and populate the environment variables (At least Azure OpenAI service to test out AI Chat feature).
3. Retrive the Neon API Key: Create [create a new API Key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) and set it in the `.env.local ` file to the value of `NEON_API_KEY`.
4. Install npm packages by running `npm install`
5. Start the app by running `npm run dev`
6. It automatically creates a new database for the dev user on Neon database and populates schemas from `./data/schema.sql` SQL file used in the application.
7. Access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should now be prompted to login with your chosen OAuth provider.

> [!NOTE]
> If using Basic Auth (DEV ONLY) any username you enter will create a new user id (hash of username@localhost). You can use this to simulate multiple users. Once successfully logged in, you can start creating new conversations.


## Deployment Options

### Prerequisites

- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
 - Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](docs/deploy_existing.md#resource-group).
  - Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

You can deploy the application using one of the following options:

- [1. Azure Developer CLI](#azure-developer-cli)
- [2. Azure Portal Deployment](#azure-portal-deployment)

### 1. Azure Developer CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section will create Azure resources and deploy the solution from your local environment using the Azure Developer CLI. Note that you do not need to clone this repo to complete these steps.

1. Download the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
2. Run `azd auth login` and log in using your Azure account credentials.
3. If you have not cloned this repo, run `azd init -t https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/azure-tenant-ai-chat`. If you have cloned this repo, just run 'azd init' from the repo root directory.
4. Run `azd up` to provision and deploy the application

### 2. Azure Portal Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> This button will only create Azure resources. You will still need to deploy the application by following the [deploy to Azure section](/docs/deploy-to-azure-github-actions.md) to build and deploy the application using GitHub actions.

Click on the Deploy to Azure button to deploy the Azure resources for the application.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fneondatabase-lab%2Fazure-tenant-ai-chat%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The application is protected by an identity provider and follow the steps in [Add an identity provider](/docs/add-identity.md) section for adding authentication to your app.

## Azure Deployment Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator - Sample Estimate](https://azure.com/e/6575aeb258c54e9a84e06e90d4a0ab0c) for the resources below.

- Neon Serverless Postgres: Free US$0.00/month, free plan includes 10 projects, 0.5 GB storage, 190 compute hours, autoscaling up to 2 CU, read replicas, 90+ Postgres extensions including pgvector extension.
- Azure App Service: Premium V3 Tier 1 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB Storage. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure Open AI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Embedding models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Form Recognizer: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Form Recognizer by changing the parameters file under the `./infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, you can have the free Form Recognizer resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Form Recognizer by reducing the number of documents you upload.

> [!WARNING]
> To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to destroy your provisioned resources by deleting the resource group.
