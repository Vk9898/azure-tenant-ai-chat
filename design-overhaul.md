## Next Steps

1. Update other authentication pages:

## General Design System Principles Applied

- **Minimalism**: Removing unnecessary decorative elements, focusing on clarity
- **Distinctive Identity**: Consistently applying rounded-xs, border-2 emphasis, typography styles
- **Consistency**: Using tokens, components, and patterns uniformly
- **Accessibility**: Implementing proper focus management, keyboard navigation, and sufficient contrast
- **Mobile-First**: Designing for smaller screens first, then enhancing for larger displays
